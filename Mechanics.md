## Darwin NFT Game Mechanic: Evolution Battles with Permanent Boosts and Gasless Battles

The Evolution Battles game mechanic is designed for the Ethereum blockchain and aims to create a reducing supply of Darwin NFTs. This mechanic encourages players to engage in battles, evolve their Darwins, and strategically burn NFTs to progress through the game.

### Overview

In Evolution Battles, players use their Darwin NFTs to participate in battles against other players. The battles are turn-based, and each player's Darwin has a set of attributes (Health, Stamina, Strength, Intelligence, Speed, and Luck) that determine their performance in the battle. The goal is to evolve your Darwin through various stages by winning battles and strategically burning NFTs to gain new abilities and traits.

### Game Mechanics

1. **Battles**: Players can challenge other players to battles using their Darwin NFTs. The outcome of each battle is determined by the attributes of the participating Darwins and a random element influenced by the Luck attribute. Winning battles rewards players with experience points (XP) that contribute to their Darwin's evolution progress.

2. **Evolution**: As a Darwin gains XP, it evolves through different stages, starting from Caveman and progressing forward. Each evolution stage unlocks new abilities, traits, and cosmetic upgrades for the Darwin. The evolution stage is stored as an attribute in the NFT metadata.

3. **Burn Mechanic**: Players can strategically burn their Darwin NFTs to gain permanent boosts in attributes or unlock new abilities for their remaining Darwins. This mechanic creates a reducing supply of Darwin NFTs, increasing their scarcity and value. The burn mechanic can be limited to a certain number of times per player or Darwin to maintain a healthy ecosystem.

4. **Marketplace**: Players can trade, sell, or buy Darwins and their associated items (weapons, armor, accessories) in a decentralized marketplace. This marketplace allows players to acquire new Darwins or upgrade their existing ones.

### Reducing Supply

The Evolution Battles game mechanic creates a reducing supply of Darwin NFTs by incentivizing players to burn their NFTs for strategic advantages. As players burn NFTs to gain permanent attribute boosts or unlock new abilities, the overall supply of Darwin NFTs decreases, increasing their scarcity and value.

This mechanic encourages players to make strategic decisions about which NFTs to burn and when, adding depth and complexity to the game. Additionally, the reducing supply creates a dynamic economy within the game, where the value of Darwins and their associated items can fluctuate based on supply and demand.
